The goal of this app is to provide an interactive interface to help learn and
teach basic quantitative variables univariate and bivariate analysis and
visualization. You can display basic statistics and visualizations, play
around with parameters, zoom, pan, drag data points, and everything should be
updated dynamically with transitions.

It is build on D3js, and can run in any modern browser (no server side
installation needed).

### Data sources

Data can be manually typed, randomly generated from several distributions, or
you can load a simple included dataset. Note that when a dataset is loaded,
you won't be able to drag the points (as you shouldn't be able to do that in a
real analysis).
